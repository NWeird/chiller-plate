                    <h3><strong>Teo</strong></h3>
                    <p>I am a graphic artist as well as aspiring technical and software engineer. I have been drawing
                        for years and have been animating for one year. I’ve practiced in many methods of creating art
                        including oil paintings, watercolor, pottery, and digital. I often volunteer to give classes on
                        certain art topics such as animation and costume design at my local art center. While much of my
                        time is spent developing my artistic abilities, my true passion is mechanical and software
                        engineering.
                        My experience in engineering and programming starts with multiple years of taking classes in
                        LEGO mind-storms engineering, also taking part in multiple completions. I now attend WHEA a
                        project based learning school where I have gotten to spend much of my time working on robots for
                        the First Robotics Competition under the FLL, an international competition for high schools
                        entertaining the idea of STEM learning. This year our team qualified in the South Pacific
                        regionals and were alliance captains in the world finals in Houston, meaning that we were in the
                        top 8 of our finals division consisting of almost 80 teams. My responsibilities in this team are
                        currently as lead programmer, programming instructor, veteran engineer, and have learned how to
                        and been given permission to use a wide variety of power tools. I spend my free time practicing
                        coding through text and logic based rpgs, exercising for physical fitness, and practicing my
                        artwork.
