                    <p>I am a High School Student who attends Iolani School. I am a Photographer and Videographer that
                        loves to capture his surroundings. Moreover, I am the founder and CEO of the company MDC Cases.
                        I also buy and flip clothes, hotwheels, barbies, cards, etc. I am a seller on eBay, Craigslist,
                        and poshmark. Moreover, I am also very interested in stocks. My parents encouraged me to get
                        into stocks at a very young age. My uncles and parents taught me how to analyze and trade
                        stocks. In the 6th grade, my parents made me a stock account and gave me money to invest. I soon
                        started to research and trade stocks on my own. Slowly but surely, I started to make a greater
                        profit. And as time went on, I also started to invest more money.I am also the founder and
                        president of the largest club at Iolani. It is the Bubble Tea Club. This past year we had a
                        total 347 members. Our club delivers tea to our members and brings the community together
                        through the common interest of Boba. We also donate all of our proceeds to charity!
                        As of right now, I am interning for my dad. He is a real estate investor and he is teaching me
                        about market research, escrow, fees, property management, etc.
