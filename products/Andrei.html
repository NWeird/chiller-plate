                    <h3><strong>Andrei</strong></h3>
                    <p>Hello, my name is Andrei Umali and am an upcoming sophomore at Kihei Charter STEM. I was initially born in Las Vegas, Nevada but moved to the island of Maui at the age of three. I am a CEO, investor, and programmer. I can program in both JavaScript and Python at the moment and am currently learning C#. The main reason why I even got into coding was to create a food delivery app similar to Postmates that is strictly for the state of Hawaii. I have been investing in the stock market and am looking into making real estate investments later this year. I am also the CEO of a company that I created called MetaStrike. MetaStrike is a holding company for multiple e-commerce companies that I manage day to day.

                        I’ve always had a passion for entrepreneurship throughout my life. I started out reselling sneakers and hype-beast clothing brands before making the last switch to e-commerce. Through working with Shopify, I have learned how to create successful companies through brand engagement, email marketing, and advertising through influencers, facebook ads, and google keywords. In my free time, I like to take online classes on the fundamentals of business and mess around with editing software like adobe premiere, photoshop, and final cut pro. A goal of mine is to one day make the Forbes list alongside Warren Buffet one day.
